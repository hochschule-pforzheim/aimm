## Development status Artificial Intelligence Maturity Model

Artificial intelligence (AI) remains volatile for many companies and will fos-ter disruptive transformation processes in many industries. Thus, companies face continuous challenges assessing AI-readiness, current state, and AI-based requirements for change. Assessment of AI applications, services and products can be built on maturity models (MM). In this case, specialized AI-based MM (AIMM) are needed. With this work, we intend to advance the AIMM development. Aspects of small and medium sized companies (SME), privacy, and ethics are in focus.

## Dimension Assessment

For all dimensions of AIMM, you will find [related questions](./dimensions_and_related_questions.md) in our overview document.
